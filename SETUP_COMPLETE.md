```bash
# Copy template to start tracking
cp progress_template.md progress.md
```

Then update it daily with:

- Problems solved
- Concepts learned
- Questions/confusions
- Weekly goals

### 2. Print the Cheat Sheet

```
Print: resources/cheatsheets/complexity_cheatsheet.md
```

Keep it next to your computer for quick reference.

### 3. Code Along

Don't just read! Open your IDE and:

- Type out the examples
- Modify them
- Break them
- Fix them
- Understand them

### 4. Use the Patterns Guide

```
Open: resources/patterns/common_patterns.md
```

Whenever stuck, check if a pattern applies.

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: I'm stuck on a problem. What should I do?

**A**:

1. Spend 20-30 minutes thinking
2. Look at hints (not full solution)
3. If still stuck, read solution
4. Implement without looking
5. Redo after 2-3 days

### Q: How do I know if I understand?

**A**:

- Can explain to someone else?
- Can solve similar problems?
- Can code from scratch without reference?
- Understand time/space complexity?

If yes to all → You understand! ✅

### Q: Should I do all problems in order?

**A**:

- Complete each module before moving on
- Within module: do in order of difficulty
- It's OK to skip and come back later
- Focus on understanding, not completion
